            <p>During the three years of this degree, I had the opportunity to learn a lot about digital content. Whether about website and mobile application. Or 2D and 3D rendering. It is during this period, that I put my first step inside the motion design world. In the same time I start to learn by myself more about 3D. First on 3D max then rapidly move on Cinema 4D.

            <p>The main reason I chose this master was to get out my comfort zone. I spend my all childhood and high school life in the same city. I needed to discover somethings new. New people, new cultures.
            Then this master make me teached a lot about myself but also my design skill. In term of hard skill like design management, design process, analysis of the consumers or team management. I also learned that everything is possible here, you just have to push yourself to get it.
